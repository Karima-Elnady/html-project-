            <h2> <br/>  <u> Top 10 Most Popular Programming Languages  </u> </h2>
            <h3> 1. Python </h3>
               <br /> Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn,
                due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++.<br />
            <h3> 2. JavaScript </h3>
                <br />  is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; 
                “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js,
                 programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser,
                  which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser.
                   A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. <br />
            <h3> 3. Java </h3>
                 <br /> Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications,
                  which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, 
                  meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result,
                   Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.<br />
            <h3> 4. C# </h3>
                 <br /> Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C.
                  It is fully integrated with Microsoft’s .NET software framework,
                   which supports the development of applications for Windows, browser plug-ins,
                    and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of data types.<br />
             <h3> 5. Cv</h3>
                  <br />Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program, 
                  Gorton says. As one of the first programming languages ever developed, 
                  C has served as the foundation for writing more modern languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP.
                   It is also an easy language to debug, test, and maintain.<br />
             <h3> 6. C++ </h3>
                  <br /> C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications, 
                  as opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform systems. 
                  Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++.
                   Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code, Gorton says.<br />
              <h3>  7. Go </h3>
                   <br />Also referred to as Golang, Go was developed by Google to be an efficient, 
                   readable, and secure language for system-level programming. It works well for distributed systems, 
                   in which systems are located on different networks and need to communicate by sending messages to each other.
                    While it is a relatively new language, Go has a large standards library and extensive documentation.<br />
              <h3> 8. R </h3>
                   <br /> R is heavily used in statistical analytics and machine learning applications.
                    The language is extensible and runs on many operating systems. 
                    Many large companies have adopted R in order to analyze their massive data sets, so programmers who know R are in great demand. <br />
              <h3> 9. Swift </h3>
                   <br /> Swift is Apple’s language for developing applications for Mac computers and Apple’s mobile devices, 
                     including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Like many modern programming languages, 
                     Swift has a highly readable syntax, runs code quickly, and can be used for both client-side and server-side development.<br />
              <h3> 10. PHP </h3>
                   <br /> PHP is widely used for server-side web development, when a website frequently requests information from a server.
                    As an older language, PHP benefits from a large ecosystem of users who have produced frameworks, libraries, and automation tools to make the programming language easier to use.
                     PHP code is also easy to debug.<br />
