      <h2> <br/>  <u> Brief Of Programming Languages </u> </h2>
        <br/>-A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. 
Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.<br/>

        <br />-Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
 Just as many human-based languages exist, 
 there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
  The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” 
  Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” 
  Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, 
  though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.<br/>

       <br/> These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.
 For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order,
  chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.<br/>
